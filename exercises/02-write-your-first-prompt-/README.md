# Write Your First Prompt ✍️ 
Enough theory, it's time to put your prompting skills into practice. In this exercise, you will have the opportunity to write your first prompt for the AI to generate a story about entrepreneurship.

## How It Works
On the left side of the text editor, you will see the file being edited. Note that there is a variable called **PROMPT**, which will be the same throughout the course. You will only need to edit this prompt, execute, test, and that's it. The result of the prompt will appear in the same file below it, with each generation adding a new response.

## The Power of AI in Creative Writing
AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4 can be powerful tools for creative writing if used correctly. They can help you generate ideas, overcome writer's block, and even create complete stories based on your prompts. Whether you are an aspiring author or just looking to have fun with storytelling, AI can be a valuable companion on your creative journey.

> 👀 Note: Be careful, AI can generate low-quality results, so it is always necessary for a human to review and improve the generated content.

2. **Set the Scene:** Describe the setting, characters, and any important details that will shape the story.
3. **Inspire Creativity:** Use open-ended questions or scenarios that encourage the AI to think creatively.

### Example Prompt:
- **Prompt:** "Write a story about a young entrepreneur who starts a tech company in a small town. Include the challenges they face and how they overcome them."
