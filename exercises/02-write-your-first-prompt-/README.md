## The Power of AI in Creative Writing

AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4 can be powerful tools for creative writing if used correctly. They can help you generate ideas, overcome writer's block, and even generate complete stories based on your prompts. Whether you are an aspiring author or just looking to have fun with storytelling, AI can be a valuable companion on your creative journey.

> 👀 Note: Be careful, AI can generate low-quality results, so it is always necessary for a human to review and improve the generated content.

## Creating Your First Prompt

2. **Set the Scene:** Describe the setting, characters, and any important details that will shape the story.
