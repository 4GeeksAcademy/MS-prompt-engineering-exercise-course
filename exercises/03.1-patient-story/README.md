# Lesson 03.1 - Crafting a Detailed Patient Story üè•

In this lesson, we will learn how to improve prompts to get detailed and relevant patient stories. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to craft prompts that instruct the AI to provide comprehensive and accurate patient stories.

### Understanding the Current Prompt üßê

Let's start by examining the current prompt:

```
Create a Patient Story: John Doe, a 45-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of persistent chest pain. The pain is described as a pressure-like sensation, located in the center of the chest, and radiates to the left arm. The pain is exacerbated by physical activity and relieved by rest. He also reports shortness of breath, sweating, and nausea accompanying the chest pain.
```

While this prompt provides some useful information, it lacks the depth and structure needed for a detailed patient story. Let's see how we can improve it.
