# BAD_PROMPT 
Your prompt is a good starting point, but it needs more details to help the AI generate a compelling story. 

| Requirement | Evaluation |
|-------------|------------|
| Characters | ❌ (No character mentioned) |
| Scene | ❌ (No scene or setting provided) |
| Additional element | ❌ (No extra detail or context given) |

To improve your prompt, consider adding more context about the entrepreneur, such as their name, age, and goals. You could also describe the scene or setting where the story takes place, like a coffee shop or a startup incubator. Finally, think about what additional element you want to include in the story, like a challenge they face, a discovery they make, or a decision they need to make.

Here's an example prompt that you could use:

> "Write a story about 30-year-old Alexa, a determined entrepreneur who has just opened her own sustainable fashion boutique in a trendy neighborhood in Los Angeles. As she prepares for her grand opening, she faces a dilemma: whether to prioritize profits or stick to her environmental values."
