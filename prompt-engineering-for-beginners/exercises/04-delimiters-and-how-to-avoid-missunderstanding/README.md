# Delimiters and How to Avoid Misunderstanding 📝

In this lesson, we'll explore the use of delimiters, such as quotes and brackets, to clearly define input and avoid misunderstandings by the AI.

Psst! Want to know a secret? Delimiters are like the punctuation marks of the AI world. They help the AI understand where a piece of text begins and ends, making it easier to process and respond accurately.

### What are Delimiters? 🔍
Delimiters are characters or sequences of characters used to specify the boundaries of a string or a piece of text. Common delimiters include quotes (`" "`, `' '`), brackets (`[ ]`, `{ }`, `( )`), and other symbols. They help in clearly defining the start and end of the input, making it easier for the AI to understand the context.

#### Example:
```text
Translate the following text to French: 'Hello, how are you?
```

### Why Use Delimiters? 🤔
Using delimiters helps in avoiding ambiguity and ensures that the AI interprets the input correctly. Without delimiters, the AI might misinterpret the input, leading to incorrect or unexpected responses.

#### Good Prompt vs. Ambiguous Prompt:
This is a bad prompt because the AI might get confused about what exactly needs to be translated:
```text
Translate the text to French ensuring a good quality translation is too easy if you know how to use AI.
```

By using delimiters, you can make the input clear and unambiguous:
```text
Translate the text to French """ensuring a good quality translation is too easy if you know how to use AI""".
```



## Tips 💡:
1. **Practice using delimiters**: Create prompts using different types of delimiters to see how they affect the AI's understanding.
2. **Experiment with complex prompts**: Try combining multiple delimiters in a single prompt to handle more complex inputs.
3. **Review and refine**: Always review your prompts to ensure that the delimiters are used correctly and that the input is clear and unambiguous.
