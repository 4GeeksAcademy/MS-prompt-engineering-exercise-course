# 04.1 - Fix the Failing Translation Prompt 🌐

Time to put your prompt-fixing skills to the test! In this exercise, you'll encounter a failing translation prompt that needs your expert touch to make it clear and effective.

### Understanding the Problem 🧐

When creating prompts for translation, clarity is key. A poorly structured prompt can lead to incorrect or incomplete translations. Let's take a look at the failing prompt:

```
Translate the following text into Spanish provide examples of how to use the words of the text in a sentence translations made by generative AI usually are good than the ones made by traditional translators.
```

This prompt is confusing and lacks proper delimiters, making it difficult for the AI to understand what exactly needs to be translated, neither a human can understand it well.


## Instructions 📌

- Fix the  prompt to get a correct translation of the exact piece of text into Spanish. 
- Remember to use delimiters to clearly define the text to be translated.

**Hint:** Pay attention to punctuation and clarity. Make sure the text to be translated is clearly specified and the instructions are easy to understand.

Good luck! 🎉
