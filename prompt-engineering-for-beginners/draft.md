**General requirements**: All the READs should be written in a friendly and engaging tone, making the content easy to understand for users with different levels of expertise in the subject matter. The goal is to provide clear and concise explanations, examples, and instructions to help users learn about the topic and apply their knowledge effectively. It should be markdown formatted, including the title of the READ at the top of the document and a related emoji. This is an example of how the READs should be structured:

```markdown

## Subtitle 1

Explanation of the first concept, including relevant information, examples, and tips to help users understand the topic better. If possible, external resources or references can be included to provide further information.

## Subtitle 2

The same structure as above should be followed for each concept or section covered in the READ.

## Instructions ðŸ“Œ

If the read includes instructions or tasks for the user to complete, they should be clearly outlined in this section. Each task should have a brief description of what the user needs to do and any specific requirements or guidelines to follow.
